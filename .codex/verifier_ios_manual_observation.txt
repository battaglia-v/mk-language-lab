Observation: iOS app stuck on loading screen (reported by user).
At time of report, Metro packager was not reachable at http://localhost:8081/status (HTTP 000).
Metro was restarted; packager status returned HTTP 200 and iOS retry log recorded.
Update: After restarting Metro, bundling completed but runtime error surfaced:
"Incompatible React versions" (react 19.2.0 vs react-native-renderer 19.1.0) in apps/mobile/app/_layout.tsx.
Also saw "TypeError: Cannot read property 'default' of undefined" following the mismatch.
Update: Metro bundling succeeded, but app failed to run due to missing EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID.
Error: "Client Id property iosClientId must be defined to use Google auth on this platform" from apps/mobile/lib/google-auth.ts:14.

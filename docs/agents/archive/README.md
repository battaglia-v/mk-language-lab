# Agent Archive

Use this folder to store older change-log entries, retired workflows, and other historical references that shouldn’t distract active agents but still provide context when needed.

Standard convention:
- `change-log-YYYY.md` – entries older than the main file retains.
- `workflow-legacy.md` – prior communication/process docs.

Keep files dated and concise so context windows stay manageable.

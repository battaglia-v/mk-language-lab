# Localization Glossary

> **Last Updated**: 2025-10-27  > **Owner**: Vincent Battaglia  > **Review Cycle**: Monthly

This glossary records preferred Macedonian terminology and usage notes. Keep it synchronized with the shared Google Drive spreadsheet (`Македонски • MK Language Lab / Documentation / Glossary`).

| English Term | Macedonian Term | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| streak | серија | Use lowercase in UI; avoid declension unless grammatically required. |
| practice module | модул за вежбање | Consistent phrasing across Learn pages. |
| tutor | тутор | Gender-neutral usage; pair with context for clarity. |

## Maintenance Steps

1. Update both this table and the Drive spreadsheet when terminology changes.
2. Reference glossary entries in PR descriptions that introduce new copy.
3. Add pronunciation or grammar notes as needed to guide translators.

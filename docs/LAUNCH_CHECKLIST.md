## Known Issues & Limitations

### Expected (Won't Block Launch)
✓ **TTS Audio**: Users expect native recordings, we're transparent about TTS
✓ **Limited Content**: Early-stage content library, will grow over time
✓ **No Offline Mode**: Requires internet connection

### Must Fix Before Launch
⚠ **Critical Path**: Ensure practice → completion → review flow works
⚠ **Data Persistence**: User progress must save reliably
⚠ **Auth Stability**: Sign-in/sign-out must be bulletproof

## GO/NO-GO Recommendation

### ✅ GO - Ready for Soft Launch (Beta)
**Reasoning:**
- Core features implemented and working
- In-app review system ready for testing
- Store listing materials prepared
- Feedback collection plan in place

**Next Steps:**
1. Resolve any remaining console errors
2. Capture screenshots per plan
3. Deploy to Google Play Internal Testing
4. Recruit 5-10 internal testers
5. Monitor for 1 week before expanding

### 🔴 NO-GO - Block Public Launch Until:
- Soft launch complete (4-6 weeks of beta testing)
- Crash-free rate >99%
- User feedback overwhelmingly positive
- All store assets captured and approved
- Privacy policy and support infrastructure ready

## Estimated Timeline to Public Launch

- **Today**: Push Phase 5 changes ✅
- **Week 1**: Internal testing + screenshot capture
- **Week 2-3**: Closed beta (50-100 users)
- **Week 4-6**: Open beta (500-1000 users)
- **Week 7**: Public launch (if metrics pass)

**Earliest Public Launch Date:** ~6 weeks from now

## Final Recommendation: ✅ SOFT LAUNCH READY, 🔴 PUBLIC LAUNCH WAIT

**Phase 5 deliverables complete. Begin internal testing immediately.**

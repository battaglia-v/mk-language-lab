## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Removed intro section entirely rather than making it optional — simplifies flow
- Target 30-50 words/lesson instead of unlimited extraction — focused learning
- First-appearance rule for vocabulary deduplication — eliminates 8,426 duplicates
- Standard grammar templates over manual cleanup — ensures consistency
- Commit all UI polish in single atomic commit — milestone cohesion

**Issues Resolved:**

- Lesson flow too complex (5 sections with gated navigation)
- Vocabulary overload (25,560 items across all levels)
- Grammar notes with PDF artifacts (49 affected notes)
- Content gaps in some lessons (below minimum thresholds)

**Issues Deferred:**

- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Database seeding requires local PostgreSQL (JSON files correct, will seed when DB available)

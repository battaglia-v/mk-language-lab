# Milestone v1.8: Quality & Performance

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-13
**Phases:** 47-52
**Total Plans:** 10

## Overview

Comprehensive quality improvements across UX, content, and performance for all three core areas (Learn, Practice, Reader). Modernized UI components, added consistent animations, validated content quality, and implemented caching/prefetching for faster navigation.

## Phases

### Phase 47: Segmented Control Redesign

**Goal**: Modernize toggle/tab component across 4 locations (Reader, Alphabet, TextImporter, DailyLessons)
**Depends on**: Previous milestone complete
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 47-01: Tabs redesign with sliding indicator + consumer updates

**Details:**
- Redesigned base Tabs component with modern iOS-style segmented control pattern
- Established touch-friendly 48px height defaults in base component
- Simplified 4 consumer locations by removing redundant style overrides
- CSS-only approach maintains performance without JavaScript position calculation

### Phase 48: Learn UX Audit & Polish

**Goal**: Visual refinements in lesson experience — section navigation, vocabulary cards, grammar displays
**Depends on**: Phase 47
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 48-01: Section Navigation & Layout Polish (touch targets, spacing)
- [x] 48-02: Vocabulary & Grammar Visual Polish (responsive grid, animations)

**Details:**
- Mobile section stepper dots now have 48px touch targets (WCAG/mobile standard)
- Vocabulary grid shows 2 columns at 640px+ (was 768px+) for better phone landscape UX
- Added staggered fade-in animation to vocabulary cards with 50ms delay per card
- Grammar section chevrons rotate 180 smoothly instead of swapping icons

### Phase 49: Practice UX Audit & Polish

**Goal**: Exercise feedback improvements, session flow smoothness, result screens
**Depends on**: Phase 48
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 49-01: Exercise Feedback Animations (staggered choice buttons, bounce on correct)
- [x] 49-02: Results Screen Polish (animated stat reveals, consistent across modes)

**Details:**
- Unified staggered fade-in animation pattern (50ms delay per item) across all practice choice buttons
- Added bounce animation feedback when selecting correct answers
- Results page has celebratory staggered animations for stats
- Consistent timing across both practice modes (100ms -> 200-500ms -> 600ms)

### Phase 50: Reader UX Audit & Polish

**Goal**: Reading experience refinements, vocabulary lookup interactions, progress indicators
**Depends on**: Phase 49
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 50-01: Reader Library Animations (story cards, CTAs)
- [x] 50-02: Reading Experience Polish (vocabulary animations, completion celebration)

**Details:**
- Story cards across all sections animate with staggered fade-slide entrance
- Continue Reading CTA uses zoom-in-95 animation for visual emphasis
- Vocabulary bottom sheet content animates with staggered fade-slide entrance
- Mark Complete button bounces with checkmark zoom-in on success
- Progress bar uses 500ms ease-out transition with subtle glow effect

### Phase 51: Content Quality Audit

**Goal**: Translation accuracy, example quality, curriculum gap identification across A1/A2/B1
**Depends on**: Phase 50
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 51-01: POS validation & fix (verb-as-noun misclassifications)
- [x] 51-02: Translation quality audit (0 critical issues found)

**Details:**
- Created POS validation script detecting verbs misclassified as nouns
- Fixed 84 vocabulary items incorrectly tagged as nouns (actually 2nd person singular verbs)
- Created translation audit script with cross-content consistency checking
- Verified 0 critical translation issues across 2,028 curriculum vocab and 394 reader vocab items
- All 13 validation checks now pass

### Phase 52: Performance Optimization

**Goal**: Faster loading, better caching strategies, smoother page transitions and navigation
**Depends on**: Phase 51
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 52-01: Caching and prefetching optimizations

**Details:**
- Curriculum lesson data cached for 1 hour using Next.js unstable_cache with 'curriculum' tag
- Cache-Control headers added to vocabulary APIs (public s-maxage=300 for curriculum, private max-age=30 for user data)
- Navigation prefetching enabled on touch/hover for shell nav and on mount for next lesson

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- CSS-only approach over Framer Motion for tabs (performance, no JS position calculation)
- Touch target implementation: 48px invisible wrapper around smaller visual elements
- Used same animation timing pattern across Learn/Practice/Reader for consistency
- unstable_cache for curriculum data with 'curriculum' tag for cache invalidation
- Cache strategy split: public s-maxage for CDN, private max-age for user data

**Issues Resolved:**

- 84 POS misclassifications (verbs tagged as nouns)
- Vocabulary grid breakpoint too wide for phone landscape
- Inconsistent animation patterns across different sections

**Issues Deferred:**

- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None

# Roadmap: MKLanguage Learning System Overhaul

## Overview

Transform MKLanguage from a quiz-centric app into a structured, CEFR-aligned learning system. The journey starts with establishing a curriculum backbone from official UKIM materials, then layers progression tracking, practice integrity, vocabulary management, reader organization, and UX cleanup — culminating in validation that the core promise ("always resume in the right place, next step obvious") is delivered.

<objective>
Add staggered entrance animations to the Reader library page for visual consistency with Learn and Practice polish.

Purpose: Reader library currently has no entrance animations on story cards, making it feel static compared to the polished Learn and Practice sections (Phases 48-49). This creates visual inconsistency.
Output: Reader library cards and CTAs animate in with staggered fade-slide effects matching the app's established animation patterns.

**Animation patterns established in Phase 48/49:**
- `animate-in fade-in-0 slide-in-from-bottom-2 duration-200`
- `animationFillMode: 'backwards'` to prevent flash before animation
- Staggered delays: 100ms, 200ms, 300ms per item
- Stats/cards use sequential reveal pattern

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add staggered entrance animations to story cards grid</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/reader/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Add staggered entrance animations to the ReadingSampleCard components in the Stories section grid. Each card should use `animate-in fade-in-0 slide-in-from-bottom-2 duration-200` with staggered delays (100ms base + 50ms per card, cap at 500ms). Add animationFillMode: 'backwards' to prevent flash. Apply same pattern to both filtered and unfiltered story grids. DON'T animate the section headers or filter controls - only the content cards.</action>
  <verify>npm run dev, visit /en/reader, observe cards sliding in with stagger effect. Cards at top of grid appear first, lower cards follow.</verify>
  <done>Story cards animate in with staggered fade-slide on page load. Animation is subtle (200ms duration) and doesn't slow down the experience.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add entrance animations to Continue Reading CTA and Reading Stats</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/reader/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Add entrance animation to the Continue Reading card (gradient CTA at top) with `animate-in fade-in-0 zoom-in-95 duration-300` and 100ms delay. Add staggered animations to the Reading Stats summary section (completed/in-progress counts) with 200ms, 300ms delays. Apply same pattern to "Review saved words" and "Practice your saved words" CTAs with 400ms, 500ms delays. This creates a top-to-bottom reveal sequence for the library header area.</action>
  <verify>npm run dev, visit /en/reader (with some reading progress), observe Continue Reading card and stats cards animating in sequence from top to bottom.</verify>
  <done>Continue Reading CTA zooms in, stats cards and practice CTAs fade in with staggered sequence. Full header area has cohesive entrance animation.</done>

  <what-built>Staggered entrance animations on Reader library page matching Phase 48/49 polish patterns</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Visit: http://localhost:3000/en/reader
    3. Observe: Continue Reading card (if present) zooms in first
    4. Observe: Story cards fade-slide in with staggered timing
    5. Test: Refresh page multiple times to confirm animation consistency
    6. Test: Switch between Library and Workspace tabs - animations should only trigger on initial load
    7. Compare: Visit /en/practice to confirm animation timing feels similar

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Story cards animate with staggered entrance (50ms increments)
- [ ] Continue Reading CTA has zoom entrance animation
- [ ] Reading Stats section has staggered fade-in
- [ ] No animation flash (animationFillMode: backwards applied)
- [ ] Animation timing matches Phase 48/49 patterns (~200ms duration)
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] `npm run lint` shows no new warnings

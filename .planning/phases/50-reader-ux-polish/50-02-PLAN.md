<objective>
Polish the reading experience with vocabulary reveal animations, completion celebration, and progress indicator smoothness.

Purpose: The reading experience lacks feedback animations that make interactions feel responsive. Vocabulary reveals and story completion should feel celebratory, matching the established animation patterns.
Output: Vocabulary cards animate on reveal, Mark Complete button has celebration feedback, progress bar transitions smoothly.

**Animation patterns from Phase 48/49:**
- `animate-bounce-correct` for positive feedback (scale 1 to 1.05)
- `animate-in fade-in-0 slide-in-from-bottom-2` for reveals
- Progress bar uses `transition-all duration-500` for smooth width changes
- animationFillMode: 'backwards' prevents flash

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add vocabulary reveal animations in reading experience</name>
  <files>components/reader/ReaderV2Client.tsx</files>
  <action>Add entrance animations when vocabulary cards reveal in the bottom sheet or inline display. When a word is tapped and the vocabulary info appears, the content should use `animate-in fade-in-0 slide-in-from-bottom-2 duration-200`. The translation text should have a slight delay (50ms) from the header. If there are multiple vocabulary items shown (e.g., alternatives), stagger them with 100ms delays. This makes vocabulary lookups feel responsive rather than instant-appearing. DON'T change the tap interaction timing - only add visual entrance effects.</action>
  <verify>npm run dev, visit a graded reader story, tap a word, observe the vocabulary panel sliding in with animation.</verify>
  <done>Vocabulary reveals animate with fade-slide entrance. Translations feel like they're being revealed rather than suddenly appearing.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add celebration animation to Mark Complete button</name>
  <files>components/reader/MarkCompleteButton.tsx</files>
  <action>Add celebration feedback when user marks a story complete. After the button is clicked and completion succeeds: 1) Add `animate-bounce-correct` class to the button briefly (300ms), 2) The checkmark icon should have a quick scale-up animation (`animate-in zoom-in-75 duration-200`), 3) Optional: Add brief confetti-like particle effect if simple to implement with existing patterns. The goal is to make completing a reading feel rewarding, similar to completing a practice session. Use React state to manage animation trigger (e.g., `isJustCompleted` state that auto-resets after animation).</action>
  <verify>npm run dev, read a story to the end, click Mark Complete, observe celebration animation on button.</verify>
  <done>Mark Complete button bounces and checkmark zooms in on successful completion. Completion feels celebratory and rewarding.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Smooth progress bar transitions in reader header</name>
  <files>components/reader/ReaderV2Layout.tsx</files>
  <action>Enhance the reading progress bar with smooth transition. Current progress bar updates width with scroll position - add `transition-all duration-500 ease-out` to make progress changes feel fluid. Also add a subtle glow effect when progress increases (`shadow-sm shadow-primary/30` that fades). This makes scrolling through a story feel like meaningful progress. DON'T add any delays that would make the progress bar feel laggy - it should still respond to scroll position, just transition smoothly between states.</action>
  <verify>npm run dev, open a story, scroll down slowly, observe progress bar width transitioning smoothly rather than jumping.</verify>
  <done>Progress bar transitions smoothly with 500ms ease-out. Scrolling feels like measurable progress through the story.</done>

    1. Run: npm run dev

    3. Open any graded reader story (e.g., A1 - My Morning)
    4. Scroll down: Observe progress bar transitioning smoothly
    5. Tap a word: Observe vocabulary panel sliding in with animation
    6. Scroll to bottom: Click Mark Complete button
    7. Observe: Button bounce and checkmark animation on completion
    8. Test mobile: Resize browser to 375px and repeat tests

<objective>
Remove dead settings and add lightweight explainers where ambiguity exists.

Purpose: Settings should be minimal and functional. Dead options confuse users; missing explanations leave users guessing.
Output: Clean settings page with helpful context. Any unclear features have brief explainers.

**Prior decisions:**
- [PROJECT.md]: "Remove dead or unclear settings (e.g., Saved Phrases if unused)"

**Current state from audit:**
Settings page (app/[locale]/settings/page.tsx) has:
- Theme toggle (Light/Dark) — FUNCTIONAL, keep
- Language selector (English/Macedonian) — FUNCTIONAL, keep
- Daily Goal (10/20/30/50 XP) — FUNCTIONAL, keep
- Reset Progress — FUNCTIONAL, keep

**Findings:**
- No dead settings found — settings page is clean
- Saved Phrases is functional (used in translator → practice deck), NOT dead
- Main gap: No explainers for what settings affect

**Potential explainer locations:**
1. Daily Goal: Could explain how it affects progress tracking
2. Practice modes: Could explain what each mode does
3. Reader categories: New folder structure could use brief descriptions

**Key files:**
@app/[locale]/settings/page.tsx
@components/practice/PracticeHub.tsx
@app/[locale]/reader/page.tsx

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Daily Goal explainer to settings</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/settings/page.tsx, messages/en.json, messages/mk.json</files>
  <action>
Enhance the Daily Goal setting with context:
1. Update dailyGoalDesc translation to be more informative:
   - en: "Set your daily XP target. Progress bar on the Learn page tracks your goal."
   - mk: "Поставете дневна XP цел. Лентата за напредок на страницата Учи го следи вашиот напредок."

Why: Users may not understand what the daily goal affects. This connects the setting to visible UI.
  </action>
  <verify>grep "dailyGoalDesc" messages/en.json shows updated text</verify>
  <done>Daily Goal description explains its effect on progress tracking</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add practice mode descriptions to PracticeHub</name>
  <files>components/practice/PracticeHub.tsx, messages/en.json, messages/mk.json</files>
  <action>
Ensure each practice mode has a clear description:
1. Check existing translations in practiceHub namespace
2. Add/update mode descriptions if missing:
   - grammar: "Test your understanding of Macedonian grammar patterns"
   - wordSprint: "Fill in blanks in sentences — great for vocabulary in context"
   - vocabulary: "Flashcard practice with your curated word list"
   - saved: "Practice phrases you've saved from the translator"

If descriptions already exist and are clear, skip this task.
  </action>
  <verify>Check messages/en.json for practiceHub.modes.*.description keys</verify>
  <done>Each practice mode has a descriptive subtitle explaining its purpose</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify no dead UI elements remain</name>
  <files>N/A - verification task</files>
  <action>
Final audit for dead/confusing UI:
1. Check navigation for any "coming soon" or disabled items that shouldn't be visible
2. Verify no audio-related icons appear in unexpected places
3. Check practice page for any references to pronunciation

Run visual inspection via dev server:
- /en/learn - no audio icons
- /en/practice - no pronunciation tile
- /en/settings - all options functional
- /en/reader - no broken audio players

Report any issues found for fixing.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run dev, manually check routes above</verify>
  <done>No dead UI elements found, or issues documented for fixing</done>
</task>

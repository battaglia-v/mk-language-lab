<objective>
Audit and hide all audio/speaking features to prevent user confusion.

Purpose: Audio and pronunciation features are incomplete for beta. Partially working features confuse users — better to hide completely than show broken.
Output: All audio/speaking entry points removed from user-facing UI. Admin tools remain for future development.

**Prior decisions:**
- [PROJECT.md]: "Hide audio/speaking entirely — Partially working features confuse users; better to hide than show broken"
- [PROJECT.md]: Out of scope: "Audio/speaking features — not ready for beta; hide completely to avoid confusion"

**Current state from audit:**
- PracticeHub.tsx already hides pronunciation from modes (line 57-58 comment)
- /practice/pronunciation page exists and is accessible via direct URL
- ModeTileGrid.tsx has default `pronunciation` tile in defaultTiles array
- lib/routes.ts exports PRACTICE_PRONUNCIATION route
- QUEST_CATEGORY_ROUTES maps 'pronunciation' to pronunciation route
- SentenceAudioPlayer component exists in reader
- TTS API endpoint exists (/api/tts)

**Key files:**
@app/[locale]/practice/pronunciation/page.tsx
@components/practice/PracticeHub.tsx
@components/practice/ModeTileGrid.tsx
@lib/routes.ts
@components/reader/SentenceAudioPlayer.tsx

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Remove pronunciation route from navigation</name>
  <files>lib/routes.ts</files>
  <action>
Remove PRACTICE_PRONUNCIATION from user-facing routes:
1. Comment out (don't delete) PRACTICE_PRONUNCIATION constant with note "// Hidden for beta - audio not ready"
2. Comment out the 'pronunciation' entry from QUEST_CATEGORY_ROUTES mapping
3. Keep ADMIN_PRACTICE_AUDIO as it's admin-only

Why comment not delete: Makes re-enabling easy when audio is ready.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -n "PRACTICE_PRONUNCIATION" lib/routes.ts shows commented lines</verify>
  <done>PRACTICE_PRONUNCIATION commented out, quest route mapping removed</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add coming soon message to pronunciation page</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/practice/pronunciation/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the entire page content with a simple "Coming Soon" placeholder:
1. Remove all session functionality and imports
2. Show a centered card with:
   - Volume2 icon
   - "Pronunciation Practice" heading
   - "Coming soon — we're recording audio with native speakers" message
   - Button to return to /practice
3. Keep the page accessible (don't 404) to avoid broken links from external sources

Why not delete: Prevents 404 errors if users have bookmarked or linked to the page.
  </action>
  <verify>Navigate to /en/practice/pronunciation shows coming soon message, no session UI</verify>
  <done>Pronunciation page shows coming soon placeholder, no interactive features</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Remove pronunciation from ModeTileGrid defaults</name>
  <files>components/practice/ModeTileGrid.tsx</files>
  <action>
Remove the pronunciation tile from defaultTiles array:
1. Delete the 'pronunciation' entry from defaultTiles (lines 33-39)
2. Leave the rest of the component unchanged

Why delete not comment: defaultTiles is internal, not a public API. The component receives tiles as props anyway.
  </action>
  <verify>grep "pronunciation" components/practice/ModeTileGrid.tsx returns no matches in defaultTiles</verify>
  <done>Pronunciation tile removed from defaultTiles</done>
</task>

- [ ] Direct navigation to /en/practice/pronunciation shows "Coming Soon" page
- [ ] PracticeHub shows no pronunciation option
- [ ] grep "PRACTICE_PRONUNCIATION" lib/routes.ts shows commented out

- No TypeScript errors introduced
- User cannot access functional pronunciation practice
- Route exists but shows placeholder (no 404)

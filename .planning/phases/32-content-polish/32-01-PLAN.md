**Phase Context:**
- Possessive pronouns lesson exists with 6 exercises covering мој, твој, негов, нејзин
- Grammar note mentions наш/наша/наше and нивен/нивна/нивно but few exercises practice them
- MLC attribution exists in Footer but "badge" translation key suggests content badges were removed
- Reader samples have attribution structure that could display MLC badge

**Tech stack available:**
- Grammar exercises follow established JSON structure in data/grammar-lessons.json
- Exercise types: fill-blank, multiple-choice, sentence-builder, error-correction
- i18n via messages/en.json and messages/mk.json

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 30: Vocabulary display patterns established (inline annotations, expandable)
- Phase 31: localStorage patterns for user state

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Restore MLC badge in reader content</name>
  <files>lib/reader-samples.ts, messages/en.json, messages/mk.json</files>
  <action>
Check reader-samples.ts for attribution display and ensure MLC badge translation is used.

1. Verify reader samples attribution structure:
   - Each sample has attribution object with series, sourceTitle, author, handle
   - MLC content should show badge identifying it as curated content

2. Check if MLC badge needs restoration:
   - The "dailyLessons.badge" translation key exists: "Handpicked by Андри · MLC"
   - If reader content doesn't display this badge, add it to reader samples from MLC

3. If MLC attribution isn't displaying:
   - Add isMlcContent flag to relevant reader samples
   - Or use attribution.handle === 'macedonianlanguagecorner' to conditionally show badge

4. Ensure translations are bilingual:
   - en.json: "Handpicked by Андри · MLC"
   - mk.json: "Избрано од Андри · MLC"

Note: Footer already credits MLC appropriately. This task focuses on in-content attribution badges.
  </action>
  <verify>
grep -r "MLC\|Handpicked\|badge" lib/reader-samples.ts messages/en.json | head -10
npm run type-check
  </verify>
  <done>
- MLC badge appears in reader content attribution where appropriate
- Translation keys exist for both EN and MK
- No TypeScript errors
  </done>

<objective>
Improve Practice page content visibility, lesson sync communication, and onboarding to help users understand what's available to practice and why.

Purpose: Users currently don't understand the relationship between Learn → Practice. The Practice page shows modes without explaining what content is available or how it connects to lesson completion.

Output: Practice Hub with content availability indicators, improved onboarding, and clearer lesson-practice connection.

**Context from exploration:**
- Practice page DOES sync with lessons correctly (lesson-vocab API filters to completed lessons)
- But there's NO indication of what content is available before starting
- Lesson Review mode shows "Complete a lesson to unlock" but no count of available words when unlocked
- No explanation of WHY each practice mode exists or what it teaches
- No visual indication connecting "You completed 3 lessons → 45 words to practice"

**Roadmap items for Phase 35:**
- Practice page shows what content is available
- Practice syncs with lesson completion (sync works, but visibility doesn't)
- Better onboarding for Practice section

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add lesson progress indicator to Practice Hub header</name>
  <files>components/practice/PracticeHub.tsx, messages/en.json, messages/mk.json</files>
  <action>
Add a progress indicator below the Practice Hub header showing lesson completion status:
- "You've completed X lessons with Y words to review" when lessonReviewDeck.length > 0
- "Start your first lesson to unlock vocabulary practice" when no completed lessons AND authenticated
- Nothing shown for unauthenticated users (current behavior fine)

Implementation:
1. Add new section after header (before My Saved Words) with conditional rendering
2. Use existing `lessonReviewDeck.length` for word count
3. Fetch completed lesson count via new API call or derive from existing data
4. Style as subtle info bar with BookOpen icon and link to `/learn`
5. Add i18n keys: `practiceHub.lessonProgress.withLessons`, `practiceHub.lessonProgress.noLessons`

Keep it simple - informational only, not a prominent CTA.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Load Practice page with completed lessons → see "X lessons, Y words to review"
2. Load Practice page with no completed lessons → see "Start your first lesson..."
3. Load Practice page unauthenticated → no lesson progress indicator shown
4. Verify i18n works in both EN and MK
  </verify>
  <done>
- Lesson progress indicator shows word count from completed lessons
- Clear messaging for users who haven't started lessons yet
- i18n keys added for both languages
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add content descriptions to practice mode cards</name>
  <files>components/practice/PracticeHub.tsx, messages/en.json, messages/mk.json</files>
  <action>
Enhance practice mode cards with context about what they teach:

1. **Lesson Review card** (when enabled):
   - Add subtitle: "Vocabulary from your completed lessons"
   - Show word count prominently: "{count} words"

2. **Grammar card**:
   - Update description to explain content: "Practice patterns from all CEFR levels"
   - Keep as-is (always available, no lesson prerequisite)

3. **Word Sprint card**:
   - Add level indicator: "A1-B1 vocabulary at 3 difficulty levels"

4. **Vocabulary (curated) card**:
   - Update description: "Starter deck with essential words"
   - Show card count

Implementation:
- Modify PracticeModeCard component to accept optional `subtitle` prop
- Update modes array with content-specific subtitles
- Add i18n keys for new descriptions

Keep existing card layout - just add informational text, not redesign.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Each practice mode card shows descriptive subtitle explaining content
2. Word counts display correctly where applicable
3. i18n works in both languages
4. Card layout remains clean and scannable
  </verify>
  <done>
- Each practice mode explains what content it includes
- Word/lesson counts visible where relevant
- Users understand what they'll practice before starting
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Improve Lesson Review disabled state with actionable guidance</name>
  <files>components/practice/PracticeHub.tsx, messages/en.json, messages/mk.json</files>
  <action>
When Lesson Review mode is disabled (no completed lessons), improve the empty state:

Current: Shows card with "Complete a lesson to unlock vocabulary review" - not actionable

New behavior:
1. Keep the card but make it more helpful:
   - Add direct link to Learn page: "Go to Learn →"
   - Explain the flow: "Complete lessons to build your vocabulary deck"
2. Style the disabled card differently:
   - Use dashed border like the empty saved words state
   - Add a "Get started" CTA button linking to `/learn`

Implementation:
1. In PracticeModeCard, handle `disabled` state with enhanced UI
2. For `lessonReview` mode specifically, show the actionable empty state
3. Add i18n keys: `practiceHub.modes.lessonReview.emptyTitle`, `practiceHub.modes.lessonReview.emptySubtitle`, `practiceHub.modes.lessonReview.getStarted`

This makes the disabled state helpful rather than just blocking.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Load Practice page with no completed lessons
2. Lesson Review card shows dashed border, helpful message, and "Go to Learn" button
3. Clicking button navigates to Learn page
4. i18n works in both languages
5. When lessons ARE completed, card shows normal enabled state
  </verify>
  <done>
- Disabled Lesson Review card provides clear path forward
- Users understand how to unlock vocabulary practice
- Direct link to Learn page removes friction
  </done>
</task>

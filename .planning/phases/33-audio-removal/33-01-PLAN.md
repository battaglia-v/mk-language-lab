<objective>
Delete core audio infrastructure: hooks, utilities, API routes, admin page, and tests.

Purpose: Remove unused audio/listening feature code that clutters the codebase. Audio features were disabled for beta and will be rebuilt from scratch if/when needed.
Output: Clean codebase with all audio-specific files removed, TypeScript compiles, tests pass.
</objective>

**Key context:**
- Audio features marked "Out of Scope" in PROJECT.md
- Decision logged: "Hide audio/speaking entirely - Partially working features confuse users; better to hide"

@messages/mk.json

**Background:**
- About page currently shows only Vincent as creator
- i18n already has `about.creditsTitle` and `about.creditsContent` keys (unused)
- UserMenu has MLC social links (Instagram, YouTube, Linktree) that duplicate info available elsewhere
- Social links clutter the user menu and are not core to app functionality
</context>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add credits section to About page</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/about/page.tsx, messages/en.json, messages/mk.json</files>
  <action>
Add a new "Credits" section to About page after the creator section. Structure:
1. Section header using t('creditsTitle')
2. Card with MLC credit (t('creditsContent'))
3. Add i18n keys for Andri credit: `about.andriCredit` - "Grammar content and linguistic expertise provided by Andri."
4. Style consistently with existing page sections (glass-card, proper spacing)

The credits section should acknowledge:
- Macedonian Language Corner for content
- Andri for grammar expertise

Follow existing page structure pattern with Card components.

# Plan: Agent Feedback Review

## Objective

Conduct a comprehensive agent review of the learning flow and UX, identifying risks, providing recommendations, and documenting the assessment for stakeholders.

## Execution Context

- System overhaul milestone nearly complete (Phases 1-6 done)
- Core promise: "The app always resumes me in the right place and makes my next step obvious"
- Focus: Learning flow quality, UX risks, recommendations for next steps

## Context

**Review scope:**
1. End-to-end learning flow (guest → lesson → practice → progress)
2. UX consistency across main routes
3. Risk identification (user confusion, broken flows, missing features)
4. Recommendations for post-beta improvements

**Key routes to evaluate:**
- `/en` (guest home)
- `/en/learn` (authenticated dashboard)
- `/en/practice` (practice hub)
- `/en/reader` (reader library)
- `/en/translate` (translator)

## Tasks

### Task 1: Evaluate learning flow end-to-end
**Approach:** Navigate the app as a new user would

Document findings for:
1. **Guest experience**: Is the entry point clear? Can users understand what the app offers?
2. **First lesson flow**: After signing in, is the next step obvious?
3. **Progress visibility**: Can users see their progress clearly?
4. **Practice integration**: Do practice modes feel connected to lessons?
5. **Reader utility**: Is the reader discoverable and useful?

Rate each area: ✅ Strong | ⚠️ Needs attention | ❌ Problematic

### Task 2: Identify UX risks
**Approach:** Look for user confusion points

Check for:
1. **Dead ends**: Routes that don't lead anywhere useful
2. **Broken expectations**: Features that look clickable but aren't
3. **Missing feedback**: Actions without confirmation
4. **Confusing navigation**: Users might get lost
5. **Incomplete states**: Placeholder content that feels broken

Document each risk with severity (High/Medium/Low) and suggested mitigation.

### Task 3: Write recommendations
**Approach:** Prioritized suggestions for post-beta

Categories:
1. **Quick wins**: Low effort, high impact improvements
2. **Medium priority**: Important but can wait for v1.1
3. **Future considerations**: Good ideas but not urgent

Each recommendation should include:
- What to change
- Why it matters
- Rough effort estimate (small/medium/large)

### Task 4: Create FEEDBACK.md report
**Files:** `.planning/phases/07-validation/FEEDBACK.md`

Create a structured report with:
1. Executive summary (1 paragraph)
2. Learning flow evaluation (from Task 1)
3. UX risks (from Task 2)
4. Recommendations (from Task 3)
5. Overall assessment: Ready for beta? What's the biggest remaining risk?

## Verification

- [ ] All main routes visited and evaluated
- [ ] UX risks documented with severity
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable and prioritized
- [ ] FEEDBACK.md created with complete assessment
- [ ] Core promise ("resume in right place, next step obvious") validated

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive feedback document that can inform product decisions
- Clear identification of what works and what needs attention
- Actionable recommendations for post-beta improvements
- Honest assessment of beta readiness

## Output

- `.planning/phases/07-validation/FEEDBACK.md` - Agent feedback report
- Summary in SUMMARY.md with key findings

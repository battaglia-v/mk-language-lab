# Phase 18.1 Plan 04: Content Completeness Summary

**All A1/A2 lessons pass content minimums (10+ vocab, 1+ dialogue, 3+ exercises, 1+ grammar) - created reusable audit script**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-09T22:39:18Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-09T22:45:22Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (1 executed, 2 skipped - no gaps found)
- **Files created:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Created content audit script that validates curriculum completeness
- Verified all 24 A1 lessons meet minimum content requirements
- Verified all 8 A2 lessons meet minimum content requirements
- Documented B1 gap (Lesson 1 missing dialogue/exercises) - acceptable per plan
- Tasks 2 & 3 (add missing content) were unnecessary - all A1/A2 content complete

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Generate content audit report** - `16985b2` (feat)
2. **Bug fix: Detect lessons 1-2 from separate seed files** - `3b90c8c` (fix)
3. **Task 2 & 3:** Skipped - no gaps found in A1/A2 lessons

**Plan metadata:** (this commit)

## Files Created/Modified

- `scripts/curriculum/content-audit.ts` - Audit script that reads JSON files and seed files
- `.planning/phases/18.1-lesson-quality-audit/CONTENT-AUDIT.md` - Full audit report

## Decisions Made

- **Audit reveals no A1/A2 gaps:** Initial expectation was that content would need to be added, but all lessons already meet minimums
- **B1 Lesson 1 left as-is:** Per plan guidance, B1 content can remain sparse for advanced learners

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed audit to detect lessons 1-2 content**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (Audit generation)
- **Issue:** Initial audit showed A1 lessons 1-2 as missing dialogues/exercises, but content existed in separate seed files (`seed-lesson1-sample.ts`, `seed-lesson2-semejstvo.ts`)
- **Fix:** Added `parseLessonSeedFile()` helper to parse content from individual seed files
- **Files modified:** scripts/curriculum/content-audit.ts
- **Verification:** Re-run audit shows all A1 lessons passing
- **Committed in:** 3b90c8c

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (bug), 0 deferred
**Impact on plan:** Bug fix improved audit accuracy. Tasks 2 & 3 became unnecessary.

## Issues Encountered

None - audit ran successfully and revealed content is more complete than expected.

## Audit Results Summary

| Level | Total | Pass | Warn | Fail |
|-------|-------|------|------|------|
| A1 (Teshkoto) | 24 | 24 | 0 | 0 |
| A2 (Lozje) | 8 | 8 | 0 | 0 |
| B1 (Zlatovrv) | 8 | 7 | 0 | 1 |

**B1 Gap:** Lesson 1 missing dialogue and exercises (acceptable per plan - advanced level)

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 18.1 (Lesson Quality Audit) complete - all 4 plans done
- Content completeness verified for A1/A2 curriculum
- Audit script available for future validation: `npx tsx scripts/curriculum/content-audit.ts`
- Ready to transition to Phase 19 (Cloudflare Evaluation) or Phase 20 (Final Polish)

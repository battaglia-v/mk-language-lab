# Phase 18.1 Plan 02: Dark Mode Color Audit Summary

**Comprehensive dark mode audit fixing 15 components with theme-aware color tokens and dark: variants**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-09T22:14:34Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-09T22:21:23Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 15

## Accomplishments

- Scanned entire codebase for hardcoded colors (text-white, text-slate-*, bg-white)
- Fixed 4 lesson components with dark mode variants
- Fixed 11 app/practice/profile components with theme-aware tokens
- Improved dark mode compliance from ~40% to ~95%

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Scan codebase for hardcoded colors** - No commit (analysis only)
2. **Task 2: Fix hardcoded colors in lesson components** - `860cc02` (fix)
3. **Task 3: Fix hardcoded colors in app pages and UI components** - `bc39f10` (refactor)

**Plan metadata:** Pending (this commit)

## Files Created/Modified

**Lesson Components (Task 2):**
- `components/learn/SavedLessons.tsx` - Added dark variants to text colors
- `components/learn/LessonPathNode.tsx` - Theme-aware mastery colors
- `components/learn/LessonContent.tsx` - Dark mode backgrounds
- `components/learn/LearnPageClient.tsx` - Muted foreground colors

**Practice Components (Task 3):**
- `components/practice/PracticeHub.tsx` - Theme-aware accents
- `components/practice/PronunciationCard.tsx` - Dark mode borders
- `components/practice/ModeTileGrid.tsx` - Muted backgrounds

**Profile Components (Task 3):**
- `components/profile/ProfileActivityMap.tsx` - Dark calendar cells
- `components/profile/BadgesSection.tsx` - Theme-aware badges
- `components/profile/BadgeShopPreview.tsx` - Muted borders
- `components/profile/QuestsSection.tsx` - Dark mode progress
- `components/profile/LeagueStandingsCard.tsx` - Theme standings

**UI/Pages (Task 3):**
- `components/ui/badge.tsx` - Semantic destructive color
- `app/[locale]/privacy/page.tsx` - Background tokens
- `app/[locale]/upgrade/page.tsx` - Card backgrounds

## Decisions Made

- **Glass-morphism exceptions:** Notifications and Tasks modules intentionally use slate colors on dark glass surfaces - left unchanged
- **Semantic tokens:** Used `text-destructive-foreground` for error states instead of red variants
- **Opacity pattern:** Replaced `bg-white/5` with `bg-muted/20` for consistent dark mode behavior

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Dark mode color compliance at ~95%
- Remaining ~5% are intentional design choices (glass-morphism effects)
- Ready for A1 content corrections (18.1-03)

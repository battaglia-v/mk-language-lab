# Phase 18.1 Plan 01: A2/B1 Vocabulary Corrections Summary

**Applied 476 total corrections to A2 (8,372 items) and B1 (12,004 items) vocabulary, fixing proper name translations and seeding to production**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 7 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-09T22:03:14Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-09T22:11:11Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments

- Created A2 vocabulary corrections script with 217 fixes applied
- Created B1 vocabulary corrections script with 259 fixes applied
- Fixed proper names (Петар, Ана, Марија, etc.) with (name) suffix
- Added B1-specific author name corrections (Анета Дучевска, Симон Саздов)
- Seeded all three levels to production (25,568 total vocabulary items)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create A2 vocabulary corrections script** - `f48bbad` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create B1 vocabulary corrections script** - `8277241` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Seed corrected vocabulary to production** - No code commit (runtime operation)

## Files Created/Modified

- `scripts/curriculum/vocabulary-corrections-a2.ts` - A2 corrections script adapting A1 pattern
- `scripts/curriculum/vocabulary-corrections-b1.ts` - B1 corrections script with author-specific names
- `data/curriculum/structured/a2-lozje.json` - Corrected A2 vocabulary (8,372 items)
- `data/curriculum/structured/b1-zlatovrv.json` - Corrected B1 vocabulary (12,004 items)
- `data/curriculum/structured/a2-lozje.backup.json` - Backup of original A2
- `data/curriculum/structured/b1-zlatovrv.backup.json` - Backup of original B1

## Decisions Made

- Reused TRANSLATION_CORRECTIONS mapping from A1 for universal corrections (pronouns, common verbs, family terms, numbers, etc.)
- Added level-specific corrections: B1 includes textbook author names (Анета Дучевска, Симон Саздов) that were incorrectly translated
- Applied corrections directly to source files (no -corrected suffix) with backups for safety

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Authentication Gates

During execution, production database seeding required credentials:

1. Task 3: Neon PostgreSQL DATABASE_URL required
   - User provided connection string
   - Seed completed successfully
   - 25,568 vocabulary items seeded across A1/A2/B1

## Next Phase Readiness

- Vocabulary corrections complete for all three levels (A1, A2, B1)
- Production database updated with corrected content
- Ready for next plan: 18.1-02 (Dark mode deep audit)

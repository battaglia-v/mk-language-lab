# Phase 18.1 Plan 03: Exercise Variety Summary

**Two new interactive exercise types: matching (tap-to-pair words) and word_order (tap-to-arrange sentence)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-09T22:30:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-09T22:36:16Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (2 auto + 1 checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Added matching exercise type with Macedonian ↔ English word pairing
- Added word_order exercise type for sentence construction
- Both use tap-to-select UX pattern (mobile-friendly, no drag-drop)
- ExerciseSection now supports 5 exercise types total

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Add matching exercise type** - `86eb303` (feat) - completed in prior session
2. **Task 2: Add word_order exercise type** - `cb187fa` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Verification checkpoint** - approved

**Plan metadata:** (this commit)

## Files Created/Modified

- `components/learn/ExerciseSection.tsx` - Added renderMatching and renderWordOrder functions, state for selections

## Decisions Made

- **Tap-to-select over drag-drop**: Chose tap interactions for better mobile UX and accessibility
- **Instance counting for duplicates**: Word order tracks each word instance separately to handle sentences with repeated words

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Exercise variety improved from 3 to 5 types
- Ready for 18.1-04 (content completeness verification)
- New exercise types need content in curriculum JSON files to be visible

**Minimum content requirements per lesson:**
- Vocabulary: 10+ items with translations
- Dialogue: At least 1 dialogue with 4+ lines (for context)
- Exercises: 3+ exercises of varied types
- Grammar notes: 1+ grammar explanation with examples

**Current state:**
- A1: 24 lessons, vocabulary seeded, dialogues/exercises in seed-all-lessons.ts
- A2: 8 lessons, vocabulary seeded, dialogues/exercises partially covered
- B1: 8 lessons, vocabulary seeded, minimal dialogues/exercises

**Seed files:**
- seed-lesson1-sample.ts, seed-lesson2-semejstvo.ts, seed-lesson3-razbirame.ts (detailed A1)
- seed-all-lessons.ts (A1 lessons 3-24, A2 lessons with dialogues/exercises)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Generate content completeness audit report</name>
  <files>scripts/curriculum/content-audit.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create audit script that queries database and JSON files to check content completeness.

    For each lesson (A1 1-24, A2 1-8, B1 1-8), report:
    - Vocabulary count (target: 10+)
    - Dialogue count and line counts (target: 1+ with 4+ lines)
    - Exercise count by type (target: 3+ total)
    - Grammar note count (target: 1+)

    Output format (Markdown):
    ```
    ## A1 Lessons
    | Lesson | Vocab | Dialogues | Exercises | Grammar | Status |
    |--------|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------|
    | 1      | 75    | 1 (6 lines) | 3 | 3 | ✅ |
    | 2      | 187   | 0 | 0 | 6 | ⚠️ Missing dialogue/exercises |
    ...
    ```

    Flag any lesson below minimums.

  <name>Task 2: Add missing dialogues to gap lessons</name>
  <files>prisma/seeds/seed-all-lessons.ts</files>
  <action>
    Based on audit report, add dialogues to lessons that are missing them.

    Dialogue requirements:
    - 4-6 lines minimum
    - Two speakers with names
    - Macedonian text, English translation, transliteration
    - Context appropriate to lesson theme

    Use existing dialogue patterns from seed-all-lessons.ts as template.
    Focus on A1 lessons first (most used), then A2 if time permits.

    Note: B1 dialogues can remain sparse for now (advanced learners, less hand-holding needed).
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Seed file modified with new dialogues
    - `npm run type-check` passes
  </verify>
  <done>All A1 lessons have at least 1 dialogue with 4+ lines</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add missing exercises to gap lessons</name>
  <files>prisma/seeds/seed-all-lessons.ts</files>
  <action>
    Based on audit report, add exercises to lessons below minimum.

    Exercise requirements per lesson:
    - At least 1 multiple_choice
    - At least 1 fill_blank
    - At least 1 translation (or matching/word_order if implemented)

    Exercise format (from seed-all-lessons.ts):
    ```typescript
    {
      type: 'multiple_choice',
      question: 'What does "Здраво" mean?',
      options: ['Goodbye', 'Hello', 'Thank you', 'Please'],
      correctAnswer: 'B',
      explanation: 'Здраво is a common greeting meaning Hello.'
    }
    ```

    Focus on lessons with 0-2 exercises first.

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Content audit report generated
- [ ] Missing dialogues added to A1 lessons
- [ ] Missing exercises added to A1 lessons
- [ ] `npm run type-check` passes
- [ ] Re-run audit shows all A1 lessons meet minimums
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All A1 lessons have: 10+ vocab, 1+ dialogue (4+ lines), 3+ exercises, 1+ grammar
- Audit report documents current state
- Seed files updated with new content
- Database can be re-seeded with complete content
</success_criteria>

<objective>
Fix translation gaps in A1 curriculum and verify content effectiveness.

Purpose: Ensure all vocabulary has accurate translations and learning progression is pedagogically sound.
Output: Updated a1-teskoto.json with 240 empty translations fixed, progression audit report.

**Known Issues:**
- 240 empty translations in curriculum (233 A1, 4 A2, 3 B1)
- Concentrated in A1 Lessons 6 (53), 7 (44), 18 (26)
- Mix of proper names needing "(name)" labels and real vocabulary needing translations

**Established Patterns:**
- vocabulary-corrections.ts pattern: WORDS_TO_REMOVE set + TRANSLATION_CORRECTIONS map
- Translation cache in .translation-cache.json
- Validation via validate-content.ts → validation-report.json

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix empty translations in A1 curriculum</name>
  <files>scripts/curriculum/vocabulary-corrections.ts, data/curriculum/structured/a1-teskoto.json</files>
  <action>
  1. Analyze the 240 empty translations from validation-report.json
  2. Categorize items:
     - Proper names (Марко, Ангела, Мирјана, etc.) → Add to TRANSLATION_CORRECTIONS with "(name)" format
     - Real vocabulary (Училиштето, колата, соседи, etc.) → Add accurate English translations
     - Truncated/invalid words → Add to WORDS_TO_REMOVE
  3. Update vocabulary-corrections.ts with new entries
  4. Run the corrections script: `npx tsx scripts/curriculum/vocabulary-corrections.ts`
  5. Re-run validation: `npx tsx scripts/curriculum/validate-content.ts`

  Key vocabulary items to translate (sample):
  - Училиштето → The school
  - колата → the car
  - Црвената → The red (one)
  - нашите → our (plural)
  - соседи → neighbors
  - присвојни → possessive

  Do NOT use AI translation API - these are simple words that should be manually verified.
  Ensure part of speech is accurate (noun, adjective, pronoun, etc.).

  <name>Task 2: Create learning progression audit</name>
  <files>scripts/curriculum/progression-audit.ts, .planning/phases/22-content-effectiveness-audit/PROGRESSION-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
  Create a progression audit script that analyzes vocabulary complexity across lessons:

  1. Parse a1-teskoto.json, a2-lozje.json, b1-zlatovrv.json
  2. For each lesson, calculate:
     - Average word length (Cyrillic characters)
     - Part of speech distribution (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.)
     - New word introduction rate (words first appearing in this lesson)
     - Cognate ratio (words similar to English/common loanwords)
  3. Generate report showing:
     - Vocabulary complexity curve across levels
     - Any lessons that seem out of order (simpler vocab after complex)
     - Distribution of grammatical categories

  Output to PROGRESSION-AUDIT.md with tables and analysis.

  Do NOT restructure curriculum data. This is an audit/report task only.
  </action>
  <verify>test -f scripts/curriculum/progression-audit.ts && npx tsx scripts/curriculum/progression-audit.ts</verify>
  <done>PROGRESSION-AUDIT.md exists with vocabulary complexity metrics for all 40 lessons</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Spot-check exercise quality</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/22-content-effectiveness-audit/EXERCISE-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
  Review exercise quality across curriculum:

  1. Sample 2 lessons per level (6 total):
     - A1: Lessons 1 and 12 (early and mid)
     - A2: Lessons 1 and 5 (early and mid)
     - B1: Lessons 1 and 5 (early and mid)

  2. For each sampled lesson, verify:
     - Exercise questions are grammatically correct in Macedonian
     - Answer options are plausible distractors (not obviously wrong)
     - Correct answer is actually correct
     - Difficulty matches CEFR level

  3. Document in EXERCISE-AUDIT.md:
     - Summary of findings per level
     - Any critical issues found
     - Recommendations (if any)

  Read exercises from prisma/seeds/ files and curriculum JSON.
  Do NOT modify exercises - this is audit only.
  </action>
  <verify>test -f .planning/phases/22-content-effectiveness-audit/EXERCISE-AUDIT.md</verify>
  <done>EXERCISE-AUDIT.md exists documenting quality findings for 6 sampled lessons</done>
</task>

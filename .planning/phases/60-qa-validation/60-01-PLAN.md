<objective>
Final QA validation for v1.9 milestone - verify all systems work correctly before marking milestone complete.

Purpose: Ensure the app delivers on its core promise ("always resume in the right place, next step obvious") and all recent changes work correctly.
Output: Passing test suite, successful build, validated user flows.

**Core Promise:** The app always resumes me in the right place and makes my next step obvious.

**v1.9 Changes to Validate:**
- Phase 53: Security & repo hygiene
- Phase 54-57: Exercise architecture, state machine, lesson flow, answer evaluation
- Phase 59: Play Store compliance fixes (Android TWA)

**Test Infrastructure:**
- Unit tests: Vitest
- E2E tests: Playwright
- Type checking: TypeScript
- Linting: ESLint
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run full test suite</name>
  <files>N/A - validation only</files>
  <action>
Run the complete test suite to ensure all functionality works:

```bash
# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Unit tests
npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

Document any failures and fix critical issues.
  </action>
  <verify>All tests pass (or known non-critical failures documented)</verify>
  <done>Test suite passes with no critical failures</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify production build</name>
  <files>N/A - validation only</files>
  <action>
Build the production app and verify it succeeds:

```bash
npm run build
```

Check for:
- No build errors
- No TypeScript errors
- Reasonable bundle sizes
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build completes successfully</verify>
  <done>Production build succeeds</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Validate core user flows</name>
  <files>N/A - validation only</files>
  <action>
Verify the E2E tests cover the core promise:

1. **Learn flow:** User can start a lesson, complete it, see progress saved
2. **Practice flow:** User can practice vocabulary, answers are evaluated correctly
3. **Reader flow:** User can read stories, tap-to-translate works, progress is tracked
4. **Resume flow:** User returns and is shown where they left off

Check E2E test coverage for these flows.
  </action>
  <verify>E2E tests exist and pass for core user flows</verify>
  <done>Core user flows validated through E2E tests</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Final cleanup and milestone summary</name>
  <files>.planning/STATE.md, .planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
1. Update STATE.md to mark v1.9 complete
2. Update ROADMAP.md to mark v1.9 as shipped
3. Create milestone completion summary

**v1.9 Quality & Stability Accomplishments:**
- Security audit and repo hygiene
- Exercise state machine architecture
- Unified answer evaluation with Macedonian grammar support
- Play Store compliance (Android 15+, large screens)
- TWA verification fixed (no more browser wrapper)
  </action>
  <verify>STATE.md and ROADMAP.md updated</verify>
  <done>v1.9 milestone marked complete</done>
</task>

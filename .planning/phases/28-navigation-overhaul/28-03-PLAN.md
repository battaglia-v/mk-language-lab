<objective>
Remove the Learning Paths section since the main Learn page already provides level selection (A1/A2/B1/Challenge tabs) making the separate paths page redundant.

Purpose: The Learn page has evolved to show all levels with tabs, making /learn/paths redundant. Removing it simplifies the codebase and eliminates confusion about where to start learning.
Output: Deleted /learn/paths routes, removed references, updated any links pointing to paths.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Delete Learning Paths routes and update references</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/learn/paths/, components/learn/LearnPageClient.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. Delete the entire app/[locale]/learn/paths/ directory:
   - app/[locale]/learn/paths/page.tsx
   - app/[locale]/learn/paths/[pathId]/page.tsx
   - Any other files in that directory

2. Search for and update references to /learn/paths:
   - In components/learn/LearnPageClient.tsx: Remove any "View all paths" or "Learning Paths" links
   - In app/[locale]/reader/page.tsx: Check for any cross-links
   - In docs/: Leave historical references but mark as removed

3. Remove any i18n keys specific to paths page if they exist:
   - Check messages/en.json and messages/mk.json for "paths" related keys
   - Only remove if they're exclusively used by the deleted pages

4. Update any test files that reference /learn/paths:
   - Search e2e/ and tests/ directories
   - Either delete obsolete tests or update them to test the main Learn page tabs instead
  </action>
  <verify>
npm run type-check passes (no missing imports)
npm run lint passes
Navigating to /learn/paths returns 404
git grep "learn/paths" shows only historical docs/comments
  </verify>
  <done>Learning Paths routes deleted, all active references removed, related tests cleaned up</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add redirect for backward compatibility</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/learn/paths/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. Instead of fully deleting, convert app/[locale]/learn/paths/page.tsx to a redirect:
   - Import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'
   - Import { getLocale } from 'next-intl/server'
   - redirect() to /{locale}/learn?level=beginner

2. Create minimal page.tsx that just redirects:
```tsx
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';
import { getLocale } from 'next-intl/server';

export default async function LearningPathsRedirect() {
  const locale = await getLocale();
  redirect(`/${locale}/learn?level=beginner`);
}
```

3. Delete the [pathId] subdirectory entirely - individual path pages redirect to their level:
   - /learn/paths/a1 → /learn?level=beginner
   - /learn/paths/a2 → /learn?level=intermediate

Actually, simpler approach: Delete everything and rely on 404. Users who bookmarked can find the Learn page easily. No redirect needed for rarely-used internal pages.

Final decision: Delete without redirect since this is an internal page that wasn't prominently linked.
  </action>
  <verify>
npm run type-check passes
/learn page still works correctly with level tabs
/learn/paths returns 404 (acceptable for internal page)
  </verify>
  <done>Learning Paths routes fully removed, Learn page tabs serve as the entry point for all levels</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Removed Learning Paths section, navigation simplified to 4 main tabs</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run: npm run dev
2. Navigate to the app
3. Verify bottom nav shows: Learn, Tools, Practice, Reader, Resources (or similar 4-5 tabs)
4. Verify /learn page shows level tabs (A1/A2/B1/Challenge)
5. Verify /learn/paths returns 404 (acceptable)
6. Verify Resources page shows tools and saved words
7. Verify UserMenu has Profile, Settings, Help, About
8. Test on mobile viewport (375px) to ensure bottom nav looks correct

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `npm run type-check` passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] `/learn/paths` route no longer exists (404)
- [ ] No broken links to paths pages in active code
- [ ] Learn page level tabs work correctly
- [ ] Human verified navigation is clean and functional

<success_criteria>
- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- Learning Paths removed without breaking learning flow
- Main Learn page serves as sole entry point for level selection
- Phase 28 complete: navigation simplified

# Phase 28: Navigation Overhaul - Final Summary

**Navigation structure simplified from "More" catch-all to direct access**

## Accomplishments

- Replaced "More" menu with "Resources" section
- Created unified Tools page (Translate + Analyze toggle)
- Consolidated user account options in UserMenu dropdown
- Removed redundant Learning Paths section

## Navigation Changes

Before: Learn, Translate, Practice, Reader, More
After: Learn, Tools, Practice, Reader, Resources

## Files Created/Modified

- [From Plan 01: Resources and UserMenu]
- [From Plan 02: Tools page]
- [Deleted: /learn/paths, /more routes]

## Phase Complete

Ready for Phase 29: Lesson Enhancements

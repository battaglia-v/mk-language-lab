# Phase 30: Vocabulary Display & Content Audit - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-10
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Vocabulary in lessons should be **grouped by part of speech** — nouns together, verbs together, adjectives separate. This makes patterns obvious at a glance and helps learners see how words relate grammatically.

Each word shows its grammatical info clearly:
- **Gender** for nouns and adjectives (masculine/feminine/neuter)
- **Definite article forms** (стол → столот)
- **Inline annotations** right next to the word, not in separate columns
- **Color coding** to distinguish masculine/feminine/neuter visually
- **Expandable details** — click to see more grammar info, collapsed by default

Beyond display improvements, this phase includes a **comprehensive content audit** across all levels (A1, A2, B1). Some lessons have issues from PDF extraction: blank question content, grammar not displaying well, inconsistent quality between lessons. Every lesson should feel polished and cohesive.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Gender clarity** — Learners immediately see masculine/feminine/neuter for nouns and adjectives
- **Article patterns** — Show definite article forms clearly (стол → столот)
- **Logical grouping** — Vocabulary organized by part of speech so patterns are obvious
- **Content quality** — No blank placeholders, no formatting issues, consistent quality across all lessons

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Audio pronunciation — not adding sound files for vocabulary words
- That's the main exclusion; open to including whatever fits for display and content quality

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- **Inline annotations** — Gender/article shown right next to the word
- **Color coding** — Different colors for masculine/feminine/neuter
- **Expandable details** — Click to see more grammar info, collapsed by default
- **Comprehensive audit** — Fix blank/placeholder content, grammar formatting issues, and inconsistent quality across A1, A2, B1

</specifics>

## Additional Context

User emphasized "cohesion and efficiency" — lessons should feel complete and professional, not rough drafts. Some content copied from PDFs included blank question content or placeholder text that needs cleaning up.

This phase combines vocabulary display improvements with a content quality sweep. Both are needed for lessons to feel polished.

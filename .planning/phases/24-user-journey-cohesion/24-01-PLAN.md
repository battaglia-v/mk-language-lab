<objective>
Connect Learn → Practice → Reader sections with contextual "next action" CTAs so users always have a clear path forward after completing an activity.

Purpose: Reduce friction in the learning loop by surfacing relevant next steps based on context (just finished a lesson? practice it. just practiced? read something at your level).
Output: Enhanced results/completion screens with contextual navigation suggestions across all three sections.

**Key files:**
@components/learn/LessonPageContentV2.tsx (lesson completion screen, lines 651-721)
@app/[locale]/practice/results/page.tsx (practice results screen)
@app/[locale]/reader/page.tsx (reader library/workspace)
@messages/en.json
@messages/mk.json

**Context from exploration:**
- Lesson completion has "Practice Now" CTA → works well
- Practice results has: Practice Again, Back to Practice, Go Home → missing Reader suggestion
- Reader has library/workspace tabs but no "Continue learning" or "Practice vocabulary" CTAs
- My Saved Words section already bridges Practice ← Reader/Translate/Lessons

**Design principle:** Contextual suggestions, not overwhelming navigation. Each screen shows 1 primary + 1-2 secondary actions based on what makes sense AFTER that activity.

  <name>Task 1: Add "Explore Reader" CTA to practice results page</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/practice/results/page.tsx, messages/en.json, messages/mk.json</files>
  <action>
After a practice session, users should be encouraged to apply their vocabulary in context.

1. Add a new secondary CTA between "Back to Practice" and "Go Home":
   - Icon: BookOpen (already imported)
   - Label: "Read Something" / "Прочитај нешто"
   - Link: `/${locale}/reader`
   - Style: variant="outline" to match "Back to Practice"
   - Position: Third button in the actions stack

2. Add i18n keys in practiceHub namespace:
   - en: `"drills.exploreReader": "Read Something"`
   - mk: `"drills.exploreReader": "Прочитај нешто"`

Keep the existing button order logic but add the new CTA as an additional option, not a replacement.

1. Run `npm run type-check` - passes
2. Visit /en/practice/results?reviewed=5&correct=4&streak=3&duration=120&xp=25&deck=curated
3. Verify 4 buttons appear: Practice Again, Back to Practice, Read Something, Go Home
4. Click "Read Something" → navigates to /en/reader
  </verify>
  <done>Practice results page shows "Read Something" CTA that navigates to Reader</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add "Practice Vocabulary" CTA to Reader workspace tab</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/reader/page.tsx, messages/en.json, messages/mk.json</files>
  <action>
After reading, users with saved words should be encouraged to practice them. Add a contextual CTA in the Reader workspace tab (not library tab).

1. In the workspace tab section, add a card/banner when user has saved words (savedCount > 0):
   - Condition: Only show in workspace tab AND savedCount > 0
   - Position: Above or below the existing "paste text" and "browse stories" CTAs
   - Content:
     - Icon: Dumbbell or Zap
     - Heading: "Ready to practice?" / "Подготвен за вежбање?"
     - Subtext: "{count} saved words" / "{count} зачувани зборови"
     - Button: "Practice Now" / "Вежбај сега" → `/${locale}/practice/session?deck=saved`
   - Style: Use existing glass-card or similar card styling

2. Add i18n keys in reader namespace:
   - en: `"workspace.practiceReady": "Ready to practice?"`
   - en: `"workspace.savedWordsCount": "{count} saved words"`
   - en: `"workspace.practiceNow": "Practice Now"`
   - mk: `"workspace.practiceReady": "Подготвен за вежбање?"`
   - mk: `"workspace.savedWordsCount": "{count} зачувани зборови"`
   - mk: `"workspace.practiceNow": "Вежбај сега"`

Note: This appears ONLY when savedCount > 0 and on workspace tab. Don't add to library tab.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Run `npm run type-check` - passes
2. Visit /en/reader?tab=workspace with some saved words (from translator or reader)
3. Verify "Ready to practice?" card appears with correct count
4. Click "Practice Now" → navigates to /en/practice/session?deck=saved
5. Visit /en/reader?tab=library → card should NOT appear
6. Clear saved words → card should NOT appear in workspace
  </verify>
  <done>Reader workspace shows contextual "Practice Now" CTA when user has saved words</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add "Continue Learning" link to Reader library tab</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/reader/page.tsx, messages/en.json, messages/mk.json</files>
  <action>
After browsing reader content, users should have an easy path back to structured learning. Add a subtle footer link in the library tab.

1. At the bottom of the library tab content (after the story categories), add a simple text link:
   - Position: Footer area, after all story cards
   - Style: text-muted-foreground, centered, with ChevronRight icon
   - Text: "Continue your lessons →" / "Продолжи со лекциите →"
   - Link: `/${locale}/learn`

2. Add i18n keys in reader namespace:
   - en: `"library.continueLearning": "Continue your lessons"`
   - mk: `"library.continueLearning": "Продолжи со лекциите"`

This is a soft suggestion, not a prominent CTA. Users browsing the reader library are exploring, so we just remind them lessons exist.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Run `npm run type-check` - passes
2. Visit /en/reader (library tab is default)
3. Scroll to bottom of library content
4. Verify "Continue your lessons →" link appears
5. Click link → navigates to /en/learn
  </verify>
  <done>Reader library tab shows subtle "Continue your lessons" link at bottom</done>
</task>

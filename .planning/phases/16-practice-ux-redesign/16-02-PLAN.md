<objective>
Redesign the lesson content UI from a "scrolling wall" into an interactive, step-by-step learning experience.

Purpose: Currently UKIM lessons dump all vocabulary and grammar in one long scroll. Users described it as "very barebones and hard to use." A good lesson should guide learners through content progressively, with opportunities to engage and test understanding.
Output: Improved LessonContent component with collapsible sections, vocabulary flashcards, and grammar with better mobile spacing.

**Tech stack available:** Next.js 16 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Accordion component
**Established patterns:** Card components, collapsible sections

**Constraining decisions:**
- [Phase 1]: UKIM curriculum is source of truth for lesson structure
- [Project]: "The app always resumes me in the right place and makes my next step obvious"

**Issues being addressed:**
- User feedback: "Lesson UI is giant scrolling wall - very barebones"
- User feedback: "Grammar not spaced evenly on mobile UI"

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Improve VocabularySection with flashcard-style cards</name>
  <files>components/learn/VocabularySection.tsx</files>
  <action>
Redesign VocabularySection to be more interactive and visually engaging:

1. Change from vertical list to a grid of vocabulary cards (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)

2. Each vocabulary card should:
   - Show Macedonian word prominently (large, bold)
   - Show pronunciation if available (smaller, italic)
   - Initially HIDE the English translation
   - Have a "Reveal" button or tap-to-flip interaction to show English
   - Show example sentence AFTER reveal (if available)

3. Add a "Show All" toggle at the top for users who prefer to see everything

4. Use existing Card component from shadcn/ui for consistency

5. Add subtle animations: scale on hover, smooth reveal transition

6. Keep the overall styling consistent with the app's design system (use existing colors like primary, muted-foreground)

Avoid: Don't add audio playback UI since audio is disabled for beta.

  <name>Task 2: Improve GrammarSection with better mobile spacing and hierarchy</name>
  <files>components/learn/GrammarSection.tsx</files>
  <action>
Improve GrammarSection for better readability, especially on mobile:

1. Increase vertical spacing between grammar notes (gap-8 instead of gap-6)

2. Make grammar note cards more distinct:
   - Larger title text on mobile (text-lg minimum)
   - Add horizontal padding on mobile (px-4)
   - Clearer visual separation between explanation and examples

3. Improve examples section:
   - Add numbered list instead of bulleted
   - Larger text for examples (text-base)
   - Better indentation and spacing
   - If examples include translations, show Macedonian on one line, English below in muted color

4. Add collapsible behavior for long grammar notes:
   - First 2 lines of explanation always visible
   - "Read more" link to expand full explanation
   - Use the existing Collapsible component from shadcn/ui or simple state toggle

5. Responsive improvements:
   - Full-width cards on mobile (no margin)
   - Larger touch targets (min-height: 44px for interactive elements)
   - Proper text sizing that scales up slightly on mobile for readability

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Improve LessonContent overall structure</name>
  <files>components/learn/LessonContent.tsx</files>
  <action>
Improve the overall lesson flow to be more guided:

1. Make section cards collapsible:
   - Use Accordion from shadcn/ui for sections
   - Only one section open at a time (or allow multiple with state)
   - Show completion checkmark in section header
   - Currently active section auto-expands

2. Add a "section progress" indicator:
   - Small dots or steps at top showing Intro → Vocabulary → Grammar → Practice
   - Current section highlighted
   - Completed sections marked with checkmarks

3. Improve the header card:
   - Move progress bar inside the section stepper area
   - Make the header more compact on mobile
   - Remove redundant metadata that clutters the view

4. Add a floating "Continue" button at bottom:
   - Fixed position at bottom of viewport on mobile
   - Shows current section progress "Section 2 of 4"
   - Advances to next section when clicked
   - Changes to "Complete Lesson" on final section

5. Improve the completion card:
   - More celebratory (larger emoji, confetti animation if simple)
   - Clear next action (Continue to next lesson or Return to dashboard)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. npm run type-check passes
2. npm run lint passes
3. Visual: Lesson has collapsible sections with clear progress
  </verify>
  <done>
- Sections are collapsible with accordion behavior
- Progress stepper shows current position
- Floating "Continue" button on mobile
- Completion celebration improved
- Overall flow feels guided, not overwhelming

  <what-built>Redesigned lesson content UI with interactive vocabulary, improved grammar, and guided flow</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open a UKIM lesson (e.g., https://mklanguage.com/lesson/[any-a1-lesson-id])
    2. Check vocabulary section:
       - Cards display in grid
       - Tap to reveal English translation works
       - "Show All" toggle works
    3. Check grammar section:
       - Proper spacing on mobile (use device or DevTools mobile view)
       - Examples are clearly formatted
       - Long explanations can be expanded
    4. Check overall flow:
       - Sections are collapsible
       - Progress stepper shows position
       - "Continue" button advances through sections
       - Completion celebration appears at end
    5. Test on mobile viewport (375px width)

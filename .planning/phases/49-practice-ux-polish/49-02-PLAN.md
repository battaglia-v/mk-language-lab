# Prior plan from this phase:

**Patterns from Phase 48:**
- Staggered animations with animationDelay and animationFillMode: 'backwards'
- CSS-only animate-in utilities for smooth entrances

**Current state:**
- Results page has static stats display
- SessionComplete (Word Sprint) shows stats in grid
- Both lack entrance animations for stats

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add staggered stat card animations to results page</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/practice/results/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add staggered entrance animations to the stats grid on the results page for a more celebratory feel.

In ResultsPage component:

1. Add animation to the celebration header section (Trophy icon + title):
   - Apply animate-in fade-in-0 zoom-in-95 duration-300 to the header div

2. Add animation to the XP earned card (around line 43):
   - Apply animate-in fade-in-0 slide-in-from-bottom-3 duration-300
   - Add style={{ animationDelay: '100ms', animationFillMode: 'backwards' }}

3. Add staggered animation to the stats grid (around line 50):
   - Each StatCard should have incrementing delay: 200ms, 300ms, 400ms, 500ms
   - Apply animate-in fade-in-0 slide-in-from-bottom-2 duration-200

Modify StatCard component to accept animationDelay prop:
```typescript
function StatCard({ icon: Icon, value, label, color, animationDelay }: {
  icon: typeof Trophy;
  value: string;
  label: string;
  color: string;
  animationDelay?: number;
}) {
```

Then apply in the component:
```typescript
<div
  className={cn("glass-card rounded-xl p-4 text-center animate-in fade-in-0 slide-in-from-bottom-2 duration-200")}
  style={animationDelay ? { animationDelay: `${animationDelay}ms`, animationFillMode: 'backwards' } : undefined}
>
```

Update the grid to pass delays: 200, 300, 400, 500 for each StatCard.

4. Add animation to action buttons section (line 58):
   - Apply animate-in fade-in-0 duration-300
   - Add style={{ animationDelay: '600ms', animationFillMode: 'backwards' }}

Avoid: Don't change the existing XPAnimation or GoalCelebration components - those handle their own animations.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run type-check passes, results page shows stats cards animating in sequence</verify>
  <done>Results page stats reveal with staggered animations for celebratory feel</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add matching animations to Word Sprint SessionComplete</name>
  <files>components/practice/word-sprint/SessionComplete.tsx</files>
  <action>
Apply the same staggered animation pattern to SessionComplete for consistency between practice modes.

1. Add animation to XP Display section (around line 52):
   - Apply animate-in fade-in-0 zoom-in-95 duration-300
   - Add style={{ animationDelay: '100ms', animationFillMode: 'backwards' }}

2. Add staggered animation to the stats grid (around line 58):
   - Each stat card div should have animate-in fade-in-0 slide-in-from-bottom-2 duration-200
   - Stagger delays: 200ms, 300ms, 400ms for the 3 stat cards

3. Add animation to action buttons section (around line 81):
   - Apply animate-in fade-in-0 duration-300
   - Add style={{ animationDelay: '500ms', animationFillMode: 'backwards' }}

Update the stat card divs with the pattern:
```tsx
<div
  className="flex flex-col items-center gap-2 p-4 rounded-xl bg-muted/40 animate-in fade-in-0 slide-in-from-bottom-2 duration-200"
  style={{ animationDelay: '200ms', animationFillMode: 'backwards' }}
>
```

Avoid: Don't change the Exit button behavior or the header section - those should remain immediately visible.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Staggered animations on results screens for both regular practice and Word Sprint modes</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Test regular practice results:
       - Go to Practice → Vocabulary Practice
       - Complete a few questions (or click X to end early)
       - Observe results page: trophy animates in, XP fades up, stats reveal in sequence, buttons fade in last
    3. Test Word Sprint results:
       - Go to Practice → Word Sprint → Easy → answer questions
       - Complete session or click Exit
       - Observe SessionComplete: same staggered pattern for stats
    4. Mobile test (375px):
       - Animations should feel celebratory but not slow/annoying
       - Stats should be readable as they animate in

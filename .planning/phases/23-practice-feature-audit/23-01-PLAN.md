**Tech stack available:** Next.js 16, next-intl, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
**Established patterns:** useTranslations hook, t() function calls, translation keys in messages/*.json
**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 21: Tap-to-reveal pattern for vocabulary cards
- Phase 16: Practice mode cards with translations pattern

  <name>Task 1: Add i18n to My Saved Words section</name>
  <files>messages/en.json, messages/mk.json, components/practice/PracticeHub.tsx, app/[locale]/saved-words/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add translation keys for all hardcoded English text in the My Saved Words section:

**In messages/en.json and messages/mk.json, add under "practiceHub":**
```json
"savedWords": {
  "title": "My Saved Words",
  "subtitle": "Words you've saved from lessons, reading, or translating",
  "fromTranslate": "from Translate",
  "fromReader": "from Reader",
  "dueForReview": "due for review",
  "manage": "Manage",
  "practiceButton": "Practice Saved Words",
  "reviewFavorites": "Review Favorites",
  "emptyTitle": "Build your personal word bank",
  "emptySubtitle": "Save words you want to remember and practice them here",
  "howToSave": "How to save words",
  "methodTranslate": "In Translate",
  "methodTranslateDesc": "Translate a word or phrase, then tap the heart icon to save it",
  "methodReader": "In Reader",
  "methodReaderDesc": "Tap any word while reading, then tap \"Save word\" in the popup",
  "methodLessons": "In Lessons",
  "methodLessonsDesc": "Complete lessons to automatically add vocabulary to your review deck",
  "tryIt": "Try it"
},
"savedWordsPage": {
  "title": "My Saved Words",
  "wordsSaved": "{count} words saved",
  "practiceAll": "Practice All",
  "emptyTitle": "Start building your word bank",
  "emptySubtitle": "Save words you want to remember and they'll appear here for easy review and practice.",
  "waysToSave": "3 ways to save words",
  "searchPlaceholder": "Search saved words...",
  "filterAll": "All",
  "filterTranslate": "Translate",
  "filterReader": "Reader",
  "noResults": "No words match \"{query}\"",
  "clearAll": "Clear All Saved Words",
  "clearAllTitle": "Clear all saved words?",
  "clearAllDesc": "This will permanently delete all {count} saved words from both Translate and Reader. This action cannot be undone.",
  "cancel": "Cancel"
}
```

**In PracticeHub.tsx:** Replace all hardcoded strings in the My Saved Words section (lines 140-287) with t('savedWords.xxx') calls. Use the existing useTranslations('practiceHub') hook.

**In saved-words/page.tsx:** Replace all hardcoded strings with t('savedWordsPage.xxx') calls. The page already imports useTranslations('practiceHub').

Do NOT change any styling or layout - only extract strings to translations.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run type-check passes, grep for remaining hardcoded English in the My Saved Words sections shows only proper nouns and technical terms</verify>
  <done>All user-facing text in My Saved Words (PracticeHub) and saved-words page uses translation keys, both en.json and mk.json have complete translations</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add post-lesson practice prompt</name>
  <files>components/learn/LessonPageContentV2.tsx, messages/en.json, messages/mk.json</files>
  <action>
Modify the lesson completion flow to show a celebration summary with practice CTA instead of immediately navigating away.

**Current behavior (handleCompleteLesson):**
- Saves progress as completed
- Immediately navigates to next lesson or /learn

**New behavior:**
1. When user clicks "Complete Lesson" on the last section, show a completion overlay/modal with:
   - Celebration message ("Lesson Complete!")
   - Summary: vocabulary count learned, grammar notes covered
   - Two CTAs:
     - Primary: "Practice Now" → links to /practice/session?deck=lesson-review&mode=multiple-choice
     - Secondary: "Continue to Next Lesson" or "Back to Lessons" (existing behavior)

**Implementation approach:**
1. Add state: `const [showCompletion, setShowCompletion] = useState(false);`
2. Modify handleCompleteLesson to set showCompletion=true instead of navigating
3. Add completion overlay component that renders when showCompletion is true
4. Style the overlay consistent with existing Card patterns (use bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/5)
5. Add translations for completion screen text

**Translations to add (under "learn" namespace):**
```json
"lessonComplete": {
  "title": "Lesson Complete!",
  "subtitle": "Great work finishing this lesson",
  "vocabularyLearned": "{count} new words",
  "grammarCovered": "{count} grammar points",
  "practiceNow": "Practice Now",
  "practiceDesc": "Reinforce what you learned",
  "continueNext": "Next Lesson",
  "backToLessons": "Back to Lessons"
}
```

Use existing styling patterns: Card with gradient, Sparkles/Award icons, Button components.
Do NOT remove existing navigation - add this as an intermediate step.

# Phase 43: Vocabulary & Grammar Audit - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-11
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A comprehensive content audit that fully aligns vocabulary and grammar with CEFR standards. The vocabulary isn't just "cleaned up" — it's reorganized into thematic clusters that match lesson topics. If a lesson is about "At the Market," the vocabulary should be market words plus natural extensions (vegetables, fruits, bag, change).

Grammar and vocabulary are inseparable in Macedonian. Gender agreement, verb conjugation patterns, the tripartite article system, clitic doubling — these can't be taught in isolation. This phase combines what was originally Phases 43 (Vocabulary) and 44 (Grammar) into one integrated content audit.

The reference framework is the detailed CEFR-aligned syllabus covering:

**A1 Modules:** Alphabet (Cyrillic focus), Greetings (ти vs вие), Core Verbs (sum, ima, saka conjugation), Numbers (gender agreement), Family (possessives), Colors (adjective agreement)

**A2 Modules:** Daily Routine (reflexive verbs), Shopping (prices, market vocab), Geography & Directions, Health & Body. Key grammar: tripartite articles (-от/-ов/-он), Aorist vs Imperfect, clitic doubling.

**B1 Modules:** Work & Profession, Media & Current Affairs, Abstract Concepts, Social Nuance. Key grammar: verbal aspect (perfective/imperfective pairs), future tense with ќе, conditionals, има perfect.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Theme alignment** — Every vocabulary word connects to its lesson topic in thematic clusters, not random words mixed in
- **Translation accuracy** — Fix incorrect or unnatural translations
- **Level-appropriate difficulty** — A1 words feel A1, B1 words feel B1
- **Grammar integration** — Vocabulary entries include relevant grammar context (gender, conjugation patterns) where needed

All four are equally important for this phase to succeed.

## What's Out of Scope

- Audio/pronunciation work — focus is on written content only
- UI/UX changes to how vocabulary is displayed — content only
- Creating new exercise types — use existing structures

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Audit all levels equally — A1, A2, and B1 get the same curation attention
- Use the CEFR framework as the source of truth for what vocabulary belongs where
- Verb entries should come in aspectual pairs where relevant (чита/прочита)
- Include gender markers for nouns
- Grammar explanations should be rewritten for clarity where needed

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This phase merges original Phase 43 (Vocabulary Audit) and Phase 44 (Grammar Audit) into a single integrated content phase. The pedagogical reality is that Macedonian vocabulary and grammar are deeply intertwined — teaching "book" without the tripartite article system, or verbs without aspect, doesn't work.

The detailed CEFR framework provided includes:
- Specific vocabulary targets per module
- Grammar focus areas tied to each level
- Pedagogical strategies for challenging concepts (clitic doubling, aspectual distinction)

Priority is comprehensive alignment over speed — better to do this thoroughly than rush through.
